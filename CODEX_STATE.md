# CODEX_STATE

Updated at: 2026-10-04T03:47:34.114123+00:00

## Done
- User-requested restoration: removed the parent Pages CNAME. Commit 231ab3ca5c6ccbd99a4964dfc033c3d3186d4f23.
- Pages automatically reset to https://masakasakasama.github.io/ with cname=null and HTTPS enforced.
- Existing application content and launcher links are preserved.

## Current
- Parent Pages deployment succeeded (Actions run 37174983150).
- Microsoft-FDE/index.html serves the correct Microsoft FTE Study page directly over HTTPS.

## Next
- Recheck Microsoft-FDE/ after the previously cached HTTP 301 expires; no further source changes are needed.

## Blockers
- The previously requested Microsoft-FDE/ directory URL still has an edge-cached redirect to the removed domain at verification time. The index.html URL is already correct.

## Verification
- Parent and FDE Pages API: cname=null, original github.io URLs, https_enforced=true.
- Nine Home web targets (Task_management, Language_learning, warikan, Marriage_procedure, Cooking, Calender, Trip_Plan, household_budget_management_forbaby, mf-dashboard): HTTP 200 at original HTTPS URLs, with no redirect to the removed domain.
- Microsoft-FDE/index.html: HTTP 200, final URL unchanged, title Microsoft FTE Study.
- Pages settings PUT and forced FDE rebuild POST returned integration HTTP 403; automatic CNAME-removal deployment nevertheless restored the settings successfully.
